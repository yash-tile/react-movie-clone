### Introduction
The React Movie Project is a web application designed to provide users with access to a vast collection of movies, allowing them to browse, search, and discover new films easily. Built using React.js and integrated with the TMDb (The Movie Database) API, the project offers a user-friendly interface with various features, including movie browsing by categories, search functionality, user authentication, and movie details display.

### Functional Requirements

- Users should be able to create accounts, log in, and log out of the application securely.
- Authentication mechanisms must ensure user privacy in terms of watch later playlist.
  
**Navigation**
- The application must have a responsive navigation bar providing easy access to different sections, including home, login, signup, account, and search results.
- Users should be able to navigate seamlessly between pages using React Router.

**Movie Discovery**
- Users should be able to browse through various categories of movies, including upcoming releases, now playing, popular, top-rated, and genre-specific collections.
- The application should display movie posters along with relevant details such as title on hover over movie card.
  
**Search Functionality**
- Users should have the ability to search for movies using keywords.
- The search functionality should provide real-time results based on the user's input.
- Search results should include relevant movie posters with titles and brief descriptions.

**Movie Details**

- Movie details page should display comprehensive information, including synopsis, release date, runtime, genre, original language, and average rating.
- Users should have the option to watch trailers, add movies to their watchlist, and access related content.

### Non-functional requirements
**Performance**
- The application should load quickly and respond promptly to user interactions, ensuring a smooth and seamless user experience.
- Page transitions, data fetching, and rendering should be optimized to minimize latency and improve perceived performance.

**Reliability**
- The application should be highly reliable, with minimal downtime and service interruptions.
- Error monitoring and logging should be in place to detect and troubleshoot issues proactively, ensuring continuous availability and uptime.

### Overall System Structure
- Hardware Components: The application runs on standard client hardware, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
- Software Components: The frontend is built using React and TypeScript, leveraging various libraries and frameworks for UI components, state management, and routing. 
- Network Components: The application communicates with the TMDb API over the internet to fetch movie data. Additionally, user authentication and data storage may involve communication with backend servers over HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
